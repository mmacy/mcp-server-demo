Resource Server package (tutorial project).

This package contains the Resource Server (RS) implementation used throughout the tutorial.
Starting in Part 4, the RS is refactored into layers:

- App layer (server.py): Server setup, configuration, and authentication wiring
- Content layer (tools.py): Tool definitions (public and protected)

The Authorization Server (AS) is implemented separately in its own service directory.
